# Cryptocurrency Statistics Chatbot

## Introduction

This repository contains the files for the crypto-stat-bot. This is a Chatbot application built using Rasa, a conversational AI framework. The purpose of the application is to fetch the currency value of the crypto tokens by using CoinMarketCap's APIs and compare the differences between different currencies. This chatbot can be easily integrated to our slack channel and whatsapp using Twilio messaging services

---

## Prerequisites:

- Anaconda
- brew
- a virtual environment based on python version `3.7.9`
- Rasa `2.8`

## Setting up environment in MacOS (Intel - x86 Architecture):

## Maintaining multiple python versions in the system using `pyenv`

1. Install pyenv (used for maintaining multiple python versions in the system) using the following command:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install pyenv
```

2. Add the following command in your .bash_profile or .zshrc depending on the terminal you use:

```
$ eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
```

The above command sets the path to pyenv when the terminal is loaded.

3. Install new python version using pyenv using the following command:

```
$ pyenv install 3.7.9
```

The above command could fail if `Xcode` is not installed or if one is using BigSur. In that case use the following command:

```
CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include -I$(brew --prefix bzip2)/include -I$(brew --prefix readline)/include -I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include" LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib -L$(brew --prefix readline)/lib -L$(brew --prefix zlib)/lib -L$(brew --prefix bzip2)/lib" pyenv install --patch 3.7.9 < <(curl -sSL https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8ea6353.patch\?full_index\=1)
```

4. To check the python versions youâ€™ve installed in the system, use the command:

```
$ pyenv versions
```

The output would be:

```
*system
 3.7.9
```

`system` is the base python and `3.7.9` is the additional version installed using `pyenv`. By default `system` is used.

5. In order to change the version being used, use the following command:

```
$ pyenv global 3.7.9
```

## Creating virtual environment in python

1. Create a folder named `.virtualenvs` in your root directory
2. Install the python package `virtualenv` using the command:

```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

3. Navigate to the folder `.virtualenvs` and create the virtual environment using the command:

```
$ python -m venv <env_name>
```

4. Activate the environment using the command:

```
$ source <env_name>/bin/activate
```

## Installation

To use the chatbot for development, please clone the repo and run:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the bot and all of its requirements.

---

**NOTE:**
This bot should be used with python 3.7.

---

## Running the Chatbot

Use `rasa train` to train a model. The amount of memory consumed depends upon the training data added to the files.

To run the action server open a new terminal window and run the following command:

```
$ rasa run actions
```

To run the Core/NLU server use the following command:

```
$ rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"
```

In order to include environment variables during server startup, user the following commands to start the server:
Action server:

```
$ python -m server run actions
```

Core/NLU server:

```
$ python -m server run --enable-api --cors "*"
```

## One step method to run chatbot:

Use the following command to start both core and action servers in the same terminal

```
$ sh start-server.sh
```

To stop the servers, press `ctrl+c` and run:

```
$ sh stop-server.sh
```

---

### Environment variables:

The environment variables used by the `core` server are:

1. SLACK_TOKEN
2. SLACK_CHANNEL
3. SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET

## Pre-commit hooks

The `pre-commit` package has to installed from the `requirements-dev.txt` using the following command:

```
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

To add the hooks to the `.git` directory use:

```
$ pre-commit install
```

To update the hooks in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file use:

```
$ pre-commit autoupdate
```

To run the hooks on all the files in the repository use:

```
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```
